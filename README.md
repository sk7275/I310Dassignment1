Project Goal
The goal of this project is to scrape data for the top-listing cryptocurrencies from Yahoo Finance. This data can be useful for various purposes, such as financial analysis, tracking market trends, and research.

API Documentation
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Yahoo Finance does not offer an official API for accessing cryptocurrency data. However, in this project I was able to scrape the data from the website using the selenium web scraping library. I ensured that I complied with Yahoo Finance's terms of service and robots.txt file while scraping their website.

Data License
The data scraped from Yahoo Finance is subject to Yahoo Finance's terms of service. I made sure to review and comply with their terms and conditions before using the data for any purpose.

Data Attributes
Here are some common data attributes you might collect when scraping cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance:

Symbol: The symbol or ticker of the cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin).
Name: The name of the cryptocurrency.
Price: The current price of the cryptocurrency.
Market Cap: The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency.
24h Change: The percentage change in price over the last 24 hours.
Volume: The 24-hour trading volume of the cryptocurrency.
Circulating Supply: The total number of coins or tokens currently in circulation.
ATH (All-Time High): The highest price ever reached by the cryptocurrency.
ATH Date: The date when the all-time high price was reached.

Known Issues and Potential Bias
Web scraping may be subject to legal and ethical considerations. Ensure that you are complying with Yahoo Finance's terms of service and any applicable laws or regulations.
Data scraped from websites can be subject to inaccuracies or changes. Regularly update your scraping mechanism to ensure data accuracy.
Bias may exist in the data due to factors like the selection of cryptocurrencies as "top-listing," and the availability and accuracy of data on Yahoo Finance.
